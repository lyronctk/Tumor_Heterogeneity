# Tumor Clonal Heterogeneity

Written during sophomore year summer internship at Stanford University. This **quantifies tumor clonal heterogeneity** in a *sequenced* tumor sample. Utilizes data structures & techniques in C++ to **optimize run-time and memory consumption**. It also employs common bioinformatics tools/libraries, file formats, and bash to run the pipeline. 

* Improvements to be made in modularity & coding style.
